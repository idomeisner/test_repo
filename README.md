To run the python project, run the file `run_pizzeria.py`.

No arguments are needed for the project to run.

- To create a random pizza orders (`pizza_orders.json`), run `run_pizzeria.py` with the flag `-g` (`run_pizzeria.py -g`)

- To create a random `pizza_orders.json` without running the entire project, run with the flags `-g`, `-dr` (`run_pizzeria.py -g -rd`)

- You can edit the configurations (number of pizzeria workers and their work time) in `config.yml`

- After the run has finished, you can view the output report in the file `report.json`
